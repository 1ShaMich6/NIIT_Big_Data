CUSTOMER-TRANSACTION DATA - VIEWS
=================================

1. Create a view in Hive to find the Top 10 customers with max amount spent

CREATE VIEW topten AS
SELECT a.custno, b.firstname, b.lastname, b.age, b.profession, ROUND(SUM(a.amount), 3) AS amount 
FROM txnrecords a, customer b 
WHERE a.custno = b.custno
GROUP BY a.custno, b.firstname, b.lastname, b.age, b.profession
ORDER BY amount DESC LIMIT 10;


SELECT * FROM topten; 

-----------------------------------------------------

2. To delete a view, use the command DROP VIEW

DROP VIEW topten;

SHOW TABLES;

-----------------------------------------------------

3. Create a view in Hive for customers whose age is more than 45 years

CREATE VIEW age45plus AS
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE age > 45;

------------------------------------------------------
4. 
/*/When you execute the command 
	SHOW TABLES;
you will be able to see your view table.

/*/ However, if you check for the same in your browser, you will not find any folder named 'age45plus'.

/*/ This is because your table type is "VIRTUAL_VIEW"
and not "MANAGED_TABLE" or "EXTERNAL_TABLE"
