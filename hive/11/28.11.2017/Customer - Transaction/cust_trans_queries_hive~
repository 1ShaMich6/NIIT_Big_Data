CUSTOMER-TRANSACTION DATASET
============================

Q1. Find the number of transactions made by each customer.
A:
(i) SELECT custno, COUNT(*) FROM txnrecords GROUP BY custno;
----> 1 MapReduce job

(ii) SELECT custno, COUNT(*) AS custcount FROM txnrecords GROUP BY custno ORDER BY custcount;
----> 2 MapReduce jobs : 1 - group by
			 2 - order by

----------------------------------------------------------

Q2. Find the top 10 customers from the transaction data who have done maximum purchase.
A:
(i) SELECT custno, SUM(amount) AS totalamount FROM txnrecords GROUP BY custno ORDER BY totalamount DESC LIMIT 10;

(ii) 
//To round of the floating num to a particular number of decimal places --- use ROUND() method

SELECT custno, ROUND(SUM(amount), 2) AS totalamount FROM txnrecords GROUP BY custno ORDER BY totalamount DESC LIMIT 10;


(iii)
//Using the concept of Join

SELECT custno, ROUND(SUM(amount), 2) AS totalamount FROM txnrecords A JOIN customer B ON (A.custno = B.custno) GROUP BY custno ORDER BY totalamount DESC LIMIT 10;

##This will give a Semantic error
"FAILED: SemanticException Column custno Found in more than One Tables/Subqueries"
 
The above query will work in MySQL but not in Hive

REASON:
=======
MapReduce cannot figure which columns are key and which are value.  


SELECT B.custno, ROUND(SUM(A.amount), 2) AS totalamount FROM txnrecords A JOIN customer B ON (A.custno = B.custno) GROUP BY B.custno ORDER BY totalamount DESC LIMIT 10;

##This query gives more clarity to the user.
